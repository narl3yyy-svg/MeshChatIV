# Contributing to LXMFy

Patches are the preferred way to contribute. Create your changes locally,
export a `.patch` file, and send it over Reticulum.

## Generating a Patch

1. Clone or fork the repository and make your changes on a branch.
2. Stage and commit your work:
  ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Short description of the change"
  ```
3. Export the commit(s) as a `.patch` file:
  ```bash
   # Single most recent commit
   git format-patch -1

   # Last N commits
   git format-patch -N

   # All commits since a branch point
   git format-patch main..HEAD
  ```
   This produces one `.patch` file per commit (e.g. `0001-my-change.patch`).

## Sending the Patch

Send the `.patch` file as an LXMF message over Reticulum to:

```
7cc8d66b4f6a0e0e49d34af7f6077b5a
```

You can attach the file using Sideband, Meshchat, MeshchatX, or any LXMF-capable client with attachments support.  
Include a brief description of what the patch does in the message body.

## Patch Guidelines

- Keep patches focused on a single change or fix.
- Test your changes before exporting.
